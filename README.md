# parse-server-kue-example

This project is forked off from [parse-server-example](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server-example).

This Example project is using the [kue-scheduler](https://github.com/lykmapipo/kue-scheduler.git), which helps scheduling cron jobs conveniently on your Parse app, with [parse-server](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server) module on Express.

### For Local Development

* Make sure you have at least Node 4.3. `node --version`
* Clone this repo and change directory to it.
* `npm install`
* Install redis locally using http://redis.io/download
* Install mongo locally using http://docs.mongodb.org/master/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/
* Run `mongo` to connect to your database, just to make sure it's working. Once you see a mongo prompt, exit with Control-D
* Run the server with: `npm start`
* By default it will use a path of /parse for the API routes.  To change this, or use older client SDKs, run `export PARSE_MOUNT=/1` before launching the server.
* You now have a database named "dev" that contains your Parse data
* Install ngrok and you can test with devices


### Getting Started With Heroku + mLab Development

#### With the Heroku Button

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

#### Without It

* Clone the repo and change directory to it
* Log in with the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) and create an app: `heroku create`
* Use the [mLab addon](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/mongolab): `heroku addons:create mongolab:sandbox --app YourAppName`
* By default it will use a path of /parse for the API routes.  To change this, or use older client SDKs, run `heroku config:set PARSE_MOUNT=/1`
* Deploy it with: `git push heroku master`
